# TASK 
Automate the creation of joint savings accounts with a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

---

# Instructions

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:
1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

Supported browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Brave. We do not support Remix’s use on tablets or mobile devices.

Remix Desktop IDE, see releases: https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases

Ethereum-Remix a VSCode extension, see here. The documentation for the VSCode extension is located here.

### Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. Apart from exceptional cases, only the latest version receives security fixes. Furthermore, breaking changes as well as new features are introduced regularly. We currently use a 0.y.z version number to indicate this fast pace of change.
